> ### React + TypeScript (frontend) with planned Gin (backend) in Go codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React** for the frontend and planning to implement **Gin** for the backend in Go, including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

I've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **React** and **Gin** community style guides & best practices.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

The application is a social blogging site, called "Conduit." It's a Medium.com clone that provides the following functionality:

1. **Authentication**: Users can register, login, and log out. Registered users can update their profile information and view their own articles.

2. **Articles**: Users can create, update, and delete articles. They can also comment on articles, and favor or unfavorite them.

3. **Tags**: Articles can be tagged, and users can filter articles by tags.

4. **Profiles**: Users can view other profiles, follow and unfollow them.

5. **Frontend**: Built using React, the frontend is structured with reusable components and follows React's best practices. It communicates with the provided API for CRUD operations.

6. **Backend (Planned)**: The backend is planned to be built with Gin in Go, following RESTful principles, handling authentication, data storage, and server-side logic.

The application provides a real-world example of how a modern web application can be structured and offers a good opportunity for those looking to understand full-stack development using React and planning to integrate Gin in Go for the backend.

# Getting started

> To get started with the frontend, you can follow the typical React setup:
>
> npm install
> npm start
>
> Additional instructions can be provided here for both the frontend and later for the backend once the Gin implementation is complete.
